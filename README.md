# Simulation of Representation  
This model aims to simulate how the possession of scientific knowledge impacts technological inventions and other types of innovations. It conceptualizes invention as a process of recombining various elements. The NK fitness landscape model provides a useful framework for search processes of better performance of different combinations, with scientific knowledge functioning as a map for agents to explore the hills and valleys of landscapes. In this simulation, scientific knowledge representation is characterized by three attributes: size, precision, and accuracy. The size is analogous to that of the map (represented by how many states an agent can predict), precision to the mapâ€™s granularity, and accuracy to the probability of correctness. The results calculate the average value of performances after several periods of simulation.
